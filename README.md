# bootWeb-Frontend
 This was coded at my time when I was enrolled in a bootcamp.  This code will be public and made use for educational purpose and will be coninutally added to as I learn new things in and out of bootcamp.  This repo will forcus more on the FRONT-END and learning how to properly do FRONT-END.  
 
 There might be some basic back-end, for data management and dynamic loading of information.  However, this will focus more on user experienc than proper data management.
